## Temperature Data & Analysis
Navigate to [temperature_data_and_analysis](temperature_data_and_analysis), where you will find two files:
- `OW_central_delhi_du_historical_weather.json`, which contains temperature data in JSON format.
- `Delhi_Open_Weather_Data.ipynb`, which is an interactive notebook with our analysis of the temperature data. This file contains not just our code, but also information about how we obtain and use the abovementioned temperature data.

## Demographics Data & Analysis
Navigate to [demographics_data_and_analysis](demographics_data_and_analysis), where you will find two files:
- `Delhi_Demographics_Census_Data.xlsx`, an Excel file with Census data, our visualisations and basic analysis.
- `Delhi_Demographics.ipynb`, which is an interactive notebook with our work on processing the Census 2013 data prior to analysis. Once again, this file contains not just our code, but also information about how we obtain and process the Census data.
