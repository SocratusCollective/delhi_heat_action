Note that workers above the age of 64 are themselves widely considered vulnerable, but since the Census datasets do not provide counts of workers in the age group 60-64 but rather only for 60-69, we use age 69 as a cut-off for our analysis (but not our recommended action plan)\n","- Pregnant (female) workers are also widely considered vulnerable\n","  - However, the Census datasets do not allow us to identify pregnant females\n","  - Instead, we are **estimating** the count of pregnant female workers using Age Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR) data from the Sample Registration System (SRS) statistical report of 2011 https://censusindia.gov.in/nada/index.php/catalog/34790, produced by the Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India (ORGI)\n","    - Since the census data of workers does not split the age group 40-49 any further, the ASFR for this age group is averaged as (AFSR for age group 40-44 + AFSR for age group 45-49)/2\n","  - We estimate number of pregnant women as count of female workers in a given age group times ASFR divided by 1000 times 9/12, where the factor 9/12 accounts for the fact that a pregnancy term typically lasts 9 out of 12 months\n","    - Note that this underestimates the number of pregnant women, because ASFR only considers the number of pregnancies resulting in live births (and excludes those resulting in premature termination or still births, for which no data is available by age). We also assume that there is no change in ASFR across districts, area types (rural/urban) and job-types.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","$$ASFR = \\frac{\\text{Number of live births in a particular
